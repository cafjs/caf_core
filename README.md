# CAF (Cloud Assistant Framework)

Co-design permanent, active, stateful, reliable cloud proxies with your web app.

See http://www.cafjs.com 

## CAF Core

This repository contains CAF core components. 

They allow you to host many proxies (of one app) in a single node.js process, use Redis to checkpoint their state, and integrate with Cloud Foundry to scale to many processes. 

They also provide a simplified programming model that we hope will be more familiar to front-end programmers than raw node.js.
